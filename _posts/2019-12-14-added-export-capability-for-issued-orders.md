This week we have introduced a new feature to allow agencies to export NDC bookings into a number of industry file formats.

This feature can be found in the top-right corner of an issued Order.

![Feature NDC Bookings export to file](/assets/uploads/airgateway_ndc_booking_tool-export-to-file.png "Feature NDC Bookings export to file")

We currently support these formats:

* AIR (Amadeus Interface Record)
* Galor (Travelbooster)

We will keep adding more formats as there is relevant demand for them.

This feature allows to integrate easily NDC-based bookings into existing Mid/Backoffice systems or ERPs.\
For a fully-automated reporting integration we recommend modern Webservice-based solutions that we partner with like:

* [Midoco](https://www.midoco.de/)
* [Procon Solution](https://www.proconsolution.com/)
* [Cornerstone](https://ciswired.com/) (in progress)
