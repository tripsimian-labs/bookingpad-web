We have released in production the ability to request, identify, and filter adequately private fares from NDC APIs already supporting this feature.

We know how relevant are private fares for TMCs and TOs, so we had worked hard on solving this multi-provider puzzle for doing NDC a more relevant channel for our agencies.

Currently this capability is only enabled for **BA** and **LHG.** We are looking forward add more airlines to the list once they support this feature on their NDC APIs
